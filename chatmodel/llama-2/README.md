# Note:

This folder contains a LLaMA-2 finetune notebook to test & finetune the model.

To test the model, we finetuned it with a focus on capturing the conversational style of the character Rachel from the TV show "Friends". Due to GitHub's file size restrictions, the fine-tuned model weights are not hosted directly in this repository. Instead, they can be accessed through a Google Drive link provided below.
