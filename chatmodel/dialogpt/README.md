# Note:

This folder contains a DialoGPT finetune notebook to test & finetune the model. Same code is used for both small, medium and large models. The only difference is the model name chosen in the notebook.

To test the model, we finetuned it with a focus on capturing the conversational style of the character Rachel from the TV show "Friends". After the fine-tune attempts, the medium and large models were compared to see which one captures Rachel's character better. The large model was found to be better at capturing Rachel's character. We have included the fine-tuned model weights for the large model in the Google Drive link provided below. Due to GitHub's file size restrictions, the fine-tuned model weights are not hosted directly in this repository.
