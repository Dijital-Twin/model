Emily , do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding ? Do you my sister 's teeny - tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here , huh ? This is n't right . Emily Waltham says that I realise that people are going to be disappointed . But , I 'm sure they 'll come back when we can do it right . Ross Geller says that I ca n't ask people to do that ? Would you ask people to do that ? Emily Waltham says that Do n't you point your pants at me ! We have no choice ! Anywhere that 's half - decent would 've be booked months ago , Ross do n't you understand ? This is our wedding I 'm talking about .
